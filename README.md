# ColorSyncApp
ColorSyncApp is an iOS app built with SwiftUI that lets users generate random hex color codes, view them as cards, and store them locally when offline. Once online, the app syncs the data to Firebase. It features network detection, offline persistence, and real-time sync using Firebase Firestore.
